# netbox-openapi

low-level openapi bindings for netbox.

this crate is generated. do not edit by hand. changes will be overwritten by `./scripts/generate.sh`.

documentation for endpoints and models lives in `crates/netbox-openapi/docs/`.

quick use:

```toml
[dependencies]
netbox-openapi = { path = "./netbox-openapi" }
```

for the high-level client, use the `netbox` crate instead.
